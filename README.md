## Introduction
- The secret of success regarding tidying up is to start by discarding. Then organize your space, thoroughly, completely, and in one go.
- A dramatic reorganization of the home causes correspondingly dramatic changes in lifestyle and perspective. It is life transforming.
- When you put your house in order, you put your affairs and your past in order as well.
- Once you have finished putting your house in order, your life will change dramatically.

## Why You Can't Keep Your House In Order

#### You can't tidy if you've never learned how
- In most societies, tidying, which is the job that keeps a home livable, is completely disregarded because of the misconception that the ability to tidy is acquired through experience and therefore doesn't require training.

#### A tidying marathon doesn't cause rebound
- If you put your house in order in one fell swoop, you will have tidied up in one fell swoop.
- Rebound occurs because people mistakenly believe that they have tidied thoroughly, when in fact they have only sorted and stored things halfway. 
- If you put your house in order properly, you'll be able to keep your room tidy, even if you are lazy or sloppy by nature.

#### Tidy a little a day and you'll be tidying forever
- Changing lifestyle habits acquired over a span of many years is difficult.
- People cannot change their habits without first changing their way of thinking.
- The ultimate secret of tidying success is this: If you tidy up in one shot, rather than little by little, you can dramatically change your mindset. 
- This approach is the key to preventing rebound.
- If you use the right method and concentrate your efforts on eliminating clutter thoroughly and completely within a short span of time, you'll see instant results that will empower you to keep your space in order forever after.

#### Why you should aim for perfection
- Tidying is a simple physical act that can be broken down into kinds of work: deciding on whether or not to keep something and deciding where to put it. 
- If you can do these two things, then you can achieve tidying perfection.
- All you need to do is look at each item, one at a time, and decide whether or not to keep it and where to put it. 
- It is not hard to tidy up perfectly and completely in one fell swoop. Anyone can do it, and if you want to avoid rebound, it's the only way to do it. 

#### The moment you start you reset your life
- When you start tidying, you will be compelled to reset your life. As a result, your life will start to change. 
- This is why the task of putting your house in order should be done quickly — it allows your to confront the issues that are really important.
- Tidying is just a tool, not the final destination. The true goal should be to establish the lifestyle that you want  most once your house has been put in order. 

#### Storage experts are hoarders
- A booby trap lies within the term "storage."
- Storage methods do not solve the problem of how to get rid of clutter. In the end, they are only a superficial solution.
- Putting things away creates the illusion that the clutter problem has been solved. 
- This is why tidying must start with discarding. We need to exercise self-control and resist storing our belongings until we have finished identifying what we really want and need to keep.

#### Sort by category, not by location
- Tidying up by location is a fatal mistake. 
- The root of the problem lies in the fact that people often store the same type of item in more than one place.
- When we tidy each place separately, we fail to see that we're repeating the same work in many locations and become locked into a vicious circle of tidying. 
- To avoid this, tidy by category. For example, instead of deciding that today you'll tidy a particular room, set goals like "clothes today, books tomorrow."
- One reason so many of us never succeed at tidying is because we have too much stuff. This excess is caused by our ignorance of how much we actually own. 
- When we disperse storage of a particular item throughout the house and tidy one place at a time, we can never grasp the overall volume and therefore can never finish. 
- To escape this negative spiral, tidy by category, not by place.

#### Don't change the method to suit your personality
- People do not need different tidying methods based on their personality types.
- People who can't stay tidy can be categorized into just three types: the "cant-throw-it-away" type, the "cant-put-it-back" type, and the "cant-throw-it-away, can't-put-it-back" type.
- 90% of people fall into the third category while the remaining 10% of people fall into the second category.
- Very few people fall into the first category because anyone who can't throw things away will soon end up with so much stuff that their storage space overflows.
- Tidying must begin with discarding regardless of personality type. 
- Effective tidying involves only two essential actions: discarding and deciding where to store things. Of the two, discarding must come first.

#### Make tidying a special event, not a chore
- Tidying is a special event, don't do it every day.
- The work of tidying should be completed once and for all within a single period of time.
- There are two types of tidying: Daily tidying and special event tidying. Daily tidying, which consists of using something putting it back where it belongs, will always be part of our lives as long as we need to use clothes, books, writing materials, and so on. Special event tidying, which is the process of putting your house in order, should be a one and done event.
- Without putting your house in order, any attempt to tidy on a daily basis is doomed to failure. Conversely, once you have put your house in order, tidying will be reduced to the very simple task of putting things back where they belong (which will become an unconscious habit over time).
- Once you have experienced the powerful impact of a perfectly ordered space, you will never return to clutter.
- Your goal is clearly in sight. The moment you have put everything in its place, you have crossed the finish line. You only have to decide where to put things once.

## Finish Discarding First

#### Start by discarding, all at once, intensely and completely
- When you tidy your space completely, you transform the scenery. The change is so profound that you feel as if you are living in a totally different world. 
- This deeply affects your mind and inspires a strong aversion to reverting back to your previously cluttered state.
- The key is to make the change so sudden that you experience a complete change of heart. The same impact can never be achieved if the process is gradual. "Sudden" for most people in this context is around 6 months. 
- For the best results, adhere faithfully to the following rule: Tidy in the right order.
- As mentioned previously, there are only two tasks involved with tidying and getting your house in order — discarding and deciding where to keep things. Discarding must come first.
- Do not even think of putting your things away until you have finished the process of discarding. Failure to follow this rule is one reason many people never make permanent progress. 
- To summarize, the secret of success is to tidy in one shot, as quickly and completely as possible, and to start by discarding.

#### Before you start, visualize your destination
- At this point you know why it is important to discard before you start thinking about where to keep things. But to begin discarding without first thinking ahead would be like casting yourself into the negative spiral of clutter.
- Instead, begin by identifying by identifying your end goal. What do you wish to gain through tidying? Before you start getting rid of things, take the time to think through this carefully. 
- This means visualizing the ideal lifestyle you dream of. If you skip this step, not only will it delay the whole process, but it will also put you at higher risk of for rebound.
- Goals like "I want to be clutter-free" or "I want to be able to put things away" are too vague. You need to think much more deeply than that. Think in concrete terms so that you can vividly picture what it would be like to live in a clutter-free space.
- Now that you can picture the lifestyle you dream of, is it time to move on to discarding? No, not yet. Your next step is to identify why you want to live like that. 
- Look back over your notes about the kind of lifestyle you want, and think again. Why do you want what you want? Ask yourself "why?" again, for each answer. Repeat this process three to five times for every item on your list.
- As you continue to explore the reasons behind your ideal lifestyle, you will come to a simple realization. The whole point in both discarding and keeping things is to be happy. This may seem obvious, but it is important to experience this realization for yourself and let it sink into your heart. 
- Before you start tidying, look at the lifestyle you aspire to and ask yourself, "Why do I want to tidy?" When you find the answer, you are ready to move on to the next step: examining what you own. 

#### Selection criterion: does it spark joy?
- What standard should you use when deciding what to get rid of? There are several common patterns when it comes to discarding. 
- Some say to discard things when they are no longer functional. Others say to discard things when they are out of date. However, the moment you start focusing on how to choose what to throw away, you have actually veered significantly off course.
- We should focus on deciding what we want to keep, not what we want to get rid of. 
- The best way to choose what to keep and what to throw away is to take each item in one's hand and ask: "Does this spark joy?" If it does, keep it. If not, dispose of it. This is not only the simplest but also the most accurate yardstick by which to judge. 
- The trick is to actually handle each item. Don't just open up your closet and decide after a cursory glance that everything in it gives you a thrill. You must take each outfit in your hand. When you touch a piece of clothing, your body reacts. Its response to each item is different. Try it and you will see for yourself that this is true. 
- Again, the best criterion for what to keep and what to discard is whether keeping it will make you happy, whether it will bring you joy.
- Keep only those things that speak to your heart. Then take the plunge and discard all the rest. By doing this, you can reset your life and embark on a new lifestyle.

#### One category at a time
- Deciding what to keep on the basis of what sparks joy in your heart is the most important step in tidying. But what concrete steps are needed to efficiently eliminate excess?
- Don't start selecting and discarding by location. Don't think "I'll tidy the bedroom first and then move on to the living room" or "I'll go through my drawers one by one starting from the top down." 
- This approach is fatal. Why? Because most people don't bother to store similar items in the same place. In the majority of households, items that fall into the same category are stored in two or more places scattered around the house. 
- For this reason, always think in terms of category, not location.
- Before choosing what to keep, collect everything that falls within the same category at one time. Take every last item out and lay everything in one spot. 
- An example of this would be your clothing. You start by deciding that you are going to organize and tidy your clothes. The next step is to search every room of the house. Bring every piece of clothing you find to the same place, and spread them out on the floor. Then pick up each item of clothing and see if it sparks joy. Those and only those are the ones to keep. Follow this procedure for every category. 
- If you have too many items of a certain category, you can make subcategories and examine your items one subcategory at a time. 
- Gathering every item in one place is essential to the tidying process because it gives you an accurate grasp of how much you have. 
- By collecting things in one spot, you can also compare items that are similar in design, making it easier to decide whether you want to keep them. 
- Another good reason for removing all items in the same category from drawers, closets, and cupboards and spreading them out on the floor is that things that are stored out of sight lie dormant. This makes it much harder to determine whether they inspire joy or not. 
- By exposing things to the light of day, you'll find it's surprisingly easy to judge whether or not they touch your heart. 
- Lastly, dealing with just one category within a single time frame speeds up the tidying process. So be sure to gather every item in the category you are working on. Don't let any slip by unnoticed. 

#### Starting with mementos spells certain failure
- Though you should begin tidying by category and not by location, you should not begin with whatever category you want. 
- The degree of difficulty involved in selecting what what to keep and what to discard differs greatly depending on the category. 
- People have trouble discarding things that they could still use (functional value), that contain helpful information (informational value), and that have sentimental ties (emotional value). When these things are hard to obtain or replace (rarity), they become even harder to part with. 
- The process of deciding what to keep and what to discard will go much more smoothly if you begin with items that are easier to make decisions about. As you gradually work toward the harder categories, you will be honing your decision-making skills. 
- The best sequence is this: clothing first, then books, papers, komono (miscellany), and lastly, mementos. 

#### Don't let your family see
- Try not to let your family see what you decide to discard. 
- There is nothing wrong with tidying, but it can be a stressful process for parents to see what their children discard. The sheer volume of the pile can make parents anxious about whether their children can survive on what's left. 
- Parent's can also find it very painful to see clothes, toys, and mementos from the past in the discard pile, especially if they are things they gave to their child. For this reason, keeping your discard pile out of sight is considerate. It also protects your family form acquiring more than they need or can enjoy. 

#### If you're mad at your family, your room may be the cause
- You can't force your family to be tidy. 
- To quietly work away at disposing of your own excess is actually the best way of dealing with a family that doesn't tidy. It may sound hard to believe, but oftentimes when someone starts tidying, it sets off a chain reaction that encourages other people to do the same. 
- If you feel annoyed with your family for being untidy, check your own space first, especially your storage. You are bound to find things that need to be thrown away. 
- The urge to point out someone else's failure to tidy is usually a sign that you are neglecting to take care of your own space. This is why you should begin by discarding only your own things. You can leave the communal spaces to the end. The first step is to confront your own stuff.

#### What you don't need, your family doesn't either
- If you want to give something away to a family member or friend rather than donating it or throwing it away, don't push people to take it unconditionally or pressure them by making them feel guilty. 
- Find out in advance what they like, and if you find something that fits those criteria, then and only then should you show it to them. You can also offer to give it to them on the condition that it is something they would gave been willing to pay for. 
- We need to show consideration for other by helping them avoid the burden of owning more than they need or can enjoy. 

#### Tidying is a dialogue with one's self
- The act of carefully considering each object you own to see whether it sparks joy inside of you is like conversing with oneself through the medium of your possessions.
- For this reason, it is essential to create a quiet space in which to evaluate the things in your life. Ideally, you should not even be listening to music. If you need some background noise, choose environmental or ambient music with no lyrics or well-defined melodies. 
- If you want to add momentum to your tidying work, tap into the power of the atmosphere in your room rather than relying on music.
- The best time to start is early morning. The fresh morning air will keep your mind clear and your power of discernment sharp. 

#### What to do when you can't throw something away
- The main criterion for deciding whether or not to keep an item is whether or not it fills you with joy when you touch it. But it is human nature to resist throwing something away even when we know that we should. 
- Items that we can't bring ourselves to discard even when they don't inspire joy are a real problem.
- Human judgement can be divided into two broad types: intuitive and rational. When it comes to selecting what to discard, it is surprisingly our rational judgement that causes trouble. Although intuitively we know that an object has no attraction for us, our reason raises all kinds of arguments for not discarding it, such as "I might need this later" or "it's a waste to get rid of it."
- There is nothing wrong with hesitating when deciding whether to part with an item or not. The inability to decide demonstrates a certain degree of attachment to a particular object. Nor can all decisions be made on intuition alone. This is precisely why we need to consider each object with care and not be distracted by thoughts of being wasteful. 
- When you come across something that's hard to discard, consider carefully why you have that specific item in the first place. When did you get it and what meaning did it have for you then? Reassess the role it currently plays in your life.
- Every object has a different role to play. Not all clothes that have come to you need to be worn threadbare. Not every person you meet in life will become a close friend or lover. Some you will find hard to get along with or impossible to like. But these people, too, teach you the precious lesson of who you do like, so that you will appreciate those special people even more. 
- When you come across something that you cannot part with, think carefully about its true purpose in your life. You'll be surprised at how many of the things you possess have already fulfilled their role. By acknowledging their contribution and letting them go with gratitude, you will be able to truly put the things you own, and your life, in order. In the end, all that will remain are the things that you really treasure.

## Tidying By Category Works Like Magic

#### Tidying order: follow the correct order of categories
- Remember, start with clothes, then move on to books, papers, komono (miscellany), and finally, things with sentimental value. 
- If you reduce what you own in this order, your work will proceed with surprising ease. By starting with the easy things first and leaving the hardest for last, you can gradually hone your decision-making skills, so that by the end, it seems simple. 
- For the first category, clothing, divide everything into the following subcategories for increased efficiency: Tops (shirts, sweaters, etc.), Bottoms (pants, skirts, etc.), Clothes that should be hung (Jackets, coats, suits, etc.), Socks, Underwear, Bags (handbags, messenger bags, etc.), Accessories (scarves, belts, hats, etc.), Clothes for specific events (swimsuits, uniforms, etc.), and Shoes.

#### Clothing: place every item of clothing in the house on the floor
- To get started with your clothing, check every closet and dresser in your house and gather all of your clothes in one spot. Make sure you have gathered every last piece of clothing. 
- Go through each article of clothing in each subcategory and ask yourself, while holding each item, if it sparks joy in your heart. Keep those that do, and move those that don't to the discard pile. 

#### Loungewear: downgrading to "loungewear" is taboo
- Don't classify clothing you no longer wish to keep as "loungewear." If you're interested in comfortable attire specifically for lounging and relaxation, opt for dedicated pieces that you truly enjoy.

#### Clothing storage: fold it right and you solve your storage problems
- There are two storage methods for clothing: hanging and folding. Folding should be your main storage method.
- By neatly folding your clothes, you can solve almost every problem related to storage.
- Folding clothes after they have been washed and dried is also an opportunity to really notice them in all of their detail. For example, you may spot places where the cloth has frayed or see that a certain piece of clothing is becoming worn out. Folding is essentially a form of dialogue with your wardrobe. 

#### How to fold: the best way to fold for perfect appearance
- The goal of folding should be to organize the contents of each drawer so that you can see where every item is at a glance, just as you can see the spines of the books on your bookshelves.
- The key here is to store things standing up rather than laid flat. 
- To store clothes standing, they must be made compact, which means more folds. Some people believe that more folds means more wrinkles, but this is not the case. It is not the number of folds but rather the amount of pressure applied that causes wrinkling.
- The goal is to fold each piece of clothing into a simple, smooth rectangle. 
- First, fold each lengthwise side of the garment toward the center (such as the left-hand, then right-hand, sides of a shirt) and tuck the sleeves in to make a long rectangular shape. It doesn't matter how you fold the sleeves. 
- Next, pick up one short end of the rectangle and fold it toward the other short end. Then fold again, it the same manner, in halves or in thirds. The number of folds should be adjusted so that the folded clothing when standing on edge fits the height of the drawer. This is the basic principle that will ultimately allow your clothes to be stacked on edge, side by side, so that when you pull open your drawer you can see the edge of every item inside.
- If you find that the end result is the right shape but too loose and floppy to stand up, it's a sign that your way of folding doesn't match the type of clothing. Every piece of clothing has a "sweet spot" where it feels just right — a folded state that best suits that item. This will differ depending on the type of material and size of the clothing, and therefore you will need to adjust your method until you find what works. By adjusting the height when folded so that it stands properly, you'll reach the sweet spot surprisingly easily. 
- Folding goes even more smoothly if you fold thin, soft material more tightly, reducing it to a small width and height, and thick, fluffy materials less. In cases where one end of the piece of clothing is thicker than the other, it also helps to keep the thinner end in your hand while folding. 

#### Arranging clothes: the secret to energizing your closet
- Most closets are a mess for one of two reasons: they are either too full or they are not organized well. 
- To make sure your closet doesn't get too full, fold most of your clothes and keep them in drawers. Clothing that is best suited for the closet include coats, suits, jackets, skirts, and dresses. 
- A good rule of thumb is to hang any clothes that look like they would be happier hung up, such as those made with soft materials that flutter in the breeze or highly tailored cuts, which protest at being folded. These we should hang willingly. 
- The simplest way to organize your closet is to hang clothes in the same category side by side, dividing your clothes into a jacket section, a suit section, and so on. This one principle alone will transform your closet.
- A simple way to maintain the neatness of an organized closet is to arrange your clothes so that they rise to the right. By using this principle when you organize your closet, you can make the contents look far more exciting. 
- To arrange your clothes so that they rise to the right, hang heavy items on the left side of the closet and light items on the right. Heavy items include those with length, those made from heavier material, and those that are dark in color. As you move toward the right side of the closet, the length of the clothing grows shorter, the material thinner, and the color lighter. 
- By category, coats would be on the far left, followed by dresses, jackets, pants, skirts, and blouses. This is the basic order, but depending on the trends in your wardrobe, what classifies as "heavy" in each category will differ. Use your intuition to create a balance that makes it appear as if the clothes are sloping up and to the right. Additionally, organize the clothes within each category form heavy to light.  

#### Storing socks: treat your socks and stocking with respect
- Never, ever tie up your stockings. Never, ever ball up your socks.
- To fold your stockings, first untie them if you have done so. Next, lay the toes one on top of the other and fold the stocking in half lengthwise. Then fold it into thirds, making sure that the toes are inside, not outside, and that the waistband protrudes slightly at the top. Finally, roll the stocking up toward the waistband. If the waistband is on the outside when you finish, you've done it right. 
- Fold knee-high stockings the same way. With thicker material, such as tights, it is easier to roll if you fold them in half rather than in thirds. The stocking should be firm and stable when you've finished, much like a sushi roll. 
- Folding socks is easy. If you have folded back the tops, start by unfolding them. Place one sock on top of the other and follow the same principles as those for folding clothing. For low-cut socks that just cover the feet, folding twice is enough; for ankle socks, three times for knee socks and over-knee socks, four to six times. You can adjust the number of folds to achieve the height that best suits the drawer. Store the socks on edge, just as you did for clothing. 

#### Seasonal clothes: eliminate the need to store off-season clothes
- Organize your cloths on the premise that you aren't going to put off-season clothes in storage. The trick here is not to over-categorize. Divide your clothes roughly into cotton-like and wool-like materials when you put them in the drawer. 
- Categorizing by season (summer, winter, fall, and spring) or by activity, such as work and leisure, should be avoided because it is too vague. 

#### Storing books: put all your books on the floor
- Once you have finished organizing and storing your clothes, it's time to move on to books.
- Books are one of three things that people find hardest to let go. 
- To begin, remove all the books from your bookcases and put them all on the floor. You cannot judge whether or not a book really grabs you when it's still on the shelf. Like clothes and other belongings, books that have been left untouched on the shelf for a long time are dormant.
- If there are too many books to arrange on the floor all at the same time, divide them into four subcategories: General (books you read for pleasure), Practical (references, cookbooks, etc.), Visual (photo-books, etc.), and Magazines. 
- Once you have piled your books, take them in your hand one by one and decide whether you want to keep or discard each one. The criterion is, of course, whether or not it gives you a thrill of pleasure when you touch it. Limit yourself to touching only and do not start reading any of the books as reading can cloud your judgement here.

#### Unread books: "sometime" means "never"
- The most common reason for not discarding a book is "I might read it again."
- In the end, you are going to read very few of your books more than once. 
- The purpose of a book is to be read and convey the information they contain to their readers. It's the information that books contain that has meaning. There is no meaning in a book just being on your bookshelf. 
- Once you read a book, its information is inside you, so when deciding which books to keep, forget about whether you plan on reading it again or whether you've mastered what's inside. Instead keep only the books that you really love and would like to see on your bookshelf.
- Unread and partially read books are harder to part with than books we have already read. If you have any books that fall into either of these categories, stop insisting that you will read them one day. Why? Because you most likely never will.
- Only by discarding books will you be able to tell if you really want to read a certain book. If after discarding a book your feelings about it don't change or you forget about it, then you're fine as is. If you want to book so badly after getting rid of it that you're willing to buy another copy, then buy one — and this time actually read it. 

#### Books to keep: those that belong in the hall of fame
- Books that you love and read regularly are in your personal hall of fame. It is easy to identify books that fall into this category and they should be kept.
- Books that once moved your heart and that you might want to read again are the most difficult to get rid of. You can keep the specific pages of the book that you like in a file, but you will almost certainly never read them again. You are best off getting rid of these books. 
- Books that you do not like are easy to part with, simply recognize them and get rid of them. 
- Having fewer books increases the impact of the information you read. For books, timing is everything. The moment you first encounter a particular book is the right time to read it. To avoid missing that moment, keep your collection small.

#### Sorting papers: rule of thumb — discard everything
- Once you have finished organizing your books, it's time to move on to your papers. 
- There are several spots within the house where papers tend to pile up like snowdrifts. 
- The term "papers," in this context, does not include papers with sentimental value like old love letters or diaries. These kinds of papers can be left for when you tackle sentimental items later.  
- The most basic principle for sorting papers is to throw most of them away. You should dispose of anything that does not fall into one of three categories: papers currently in use, papers needed for a limited period of time, or papers that must be kept indefinitely. 
- Divide the papers that fall into any of the three categories mentioned above into two more categories: papers to be saved and papers that need to be dealt with. 
- Letters requiring a reply, forms that need to be submitted, a newspaper that you intend to read soon — make a special corner for papers like these that need to be dealt with. Make sure that you keep all such papers in one spot only. Never let them spread to other parts of the house. Get a vertical organizer or tray in which papers can be stored and keep it in a designated area. All papers requiring attention can be placed here without separating them.
- Papers that must be saved should be subdivided according to frequency of use: those used frequently and those used infrequently. 
- Infrequently used papers include insurance policies, guarantees, and leases. Since you will rarely have to use these papers, put them all into a single clear plastic folder without worrying about further categorization.
- Frequently used papers include newspaper clippings, seminar outlines, etc. These papers are meaningless unless they are stored in a way that's easy to access and read. Store these papers by inserting them into the book-like pages of a clear plastic file folder. This category  is the trickiest of them all as they tend to multiply. Reducing the volume of this category is key to organizing your papers. 
- Papers are organized into only three categories: needs attention, should be saved (contractual/legal documents), and should be saved (other). Keep all papers in one category in the same container or folder and purposely refrain from subdividing them any further by content. In other words, you only need three containers or folder to organize all of your papers. 
- Remember that your "needs attention" box ought to be empty. If there are papers in it, that means you have left things undone in your life and that require your attention. We should aspire to keep our "needs attention" boxes empty. 

#### All about papers: how to organize troublesome papers
- Do not keep seminar materials. The value that comes from a seminar is the experience of being there, not the materials they give you. 
- Do not keep credit card statements. Their whole purpose is to let you know how much money was spent on what during a particular month. Once you have confirmed that the statement is correct and have recorded the figure, the statement has fulfilled its purpose and should be discarded.
- Put all electrical appliance warranties into a single clear file, without separating them into categories. 
- Get rid of all greeting cards that do not spark joy in your heart (i.e. have sentimental value).
- Get rid of used checkbooks if you still use them.
- Get rid of pay slips. Their purpose is to let you know how much you have been paid for a specific time period. Once you have checked and recorded that figure, discard them. 

#### Komono: keep things because you love them — not "just because"
- In Japanese, komono means "small articles; miscellaneous items; accessories; small tools, parts or attachments."
- Unlike clothing or books, this category included a diverse range of items and can feel more daunting to deal with. If you deal with them in the proper order, however, this task is quite simple. 
- The basic order for sorting komono is as follows: 
	1. CDs and DVDs
	2. kin care products
	3. Makeup
	4. Accessories
	5. Valuables (passports, credit cards, etc.)
	6. Electrical equipment and appliances (digital cameras, electric cords, anything that seems vaguely "electric")
	7. Household equipment (stationary and writing materials, sewing kits, etc.)
	8. Household supplies (expendables like medicine, detergents, tissues, etc.)
	9. Kitchen goods/food supplies (spatulas, pots, blenders, etc.)
	10. Other things (spare change, figurines, etc.). 
- If you have many items related to a particular interest or hobby, such as ski equipment or tea ceremony articles, treat these as a single subcategory of their own.
- Too many people live surrounded by things they don't need "just because." You owe it to yourself to take stock of your komono and save only those that bring you joy.

#### Common types of komono: disposables
- Presents are not "things" but a means for conveying someone's feelings. If you are holding on to gifts that you do not enjoy or use, thank it for the joy it gave you when you first received it and then part with it. After all, would the person who gave it to you want you to use it solely out of a sense of obligation?
- Throw out cosmetic samples that you're "saving for later or for traveling." You're never going to use them.
- Stop saving the boxes that your cell phone or appliance came in. They are bulky and you do not need them. Treat your home as a home, not a storage container. 
- Keep a single kind of each cord for your electronics. You do not need multiples of each cord unless said cord is used daily. Get rid of mystery cords as well. If you really need it eventually, you can buy a new one for a few dollars. 
- Do not keep broken appliances unless you plan to have them fixed immediately. 
- Do not keep bedding supplies for guests unless you actually have guests that stay with you on a regular basis. Unused bedding just takes us space and smells if it just sits in a closet and isn't used frequently.
- You will never use spare buttons, so don't keep them. When a button falls off of an article of clothing, it usually means it has been well worn and loved and has reached the end of its life. If you want to keep a particular coat or jacket for a long time, sew a few spare buttons to the lining when you first buy them. If you ever actually end up needing a single button, you can always get what you need at a craft store. 
- Sell or discard products from the latest health craze. You aren't going to use them and they have served their purpose. 
- Free novelty goods don't bring you any pleasure and you will not use them. Discard or recycle these items without any qualms. 

#### Sentimental items: your parents' home is not a haven for mementos
- Now that you have organized your clothes, books, papers, and komono, it is time to tackle the last category — items that have sentimental value. 
- Sentimental items are the most difficult items to part with. The key here is to remember that no matter how wonderful things used to be, we cannot live in the past. The joy and excitement we feel here and now are more important. 
- The way to decide what to keep is to pick up each item and ask yourself, "Does this spark joy?"
- Do not send sentimental items to your parents' or anyone else's house. People never retrieve them anyway. Once they are sent "home," they will likely never be opened again.
- Handling each sentimental item and deciding which to keep and which to discard is a powerful way of processing your past. If you just stow these items away in a drawer or cardboard box, your past will become a weight that holds you back and keeps you from living in the present. To put your things in order is to put your past in order, too. It's like resetting your life and settling your accounts so that you can take the next step forward.
- It is not our memories but the person we have become because of those past experiences that we should treasure. That is the lesson these keepsakes teach us when we sort them. The space in which we live should be for the person we are becoming now, not for the person we were in the past. 

#### Photos: cherish who you are now
- Photos should be treated like all previous categories mentioned: they should be piled up and gone through one by one, asking yourself if each one sparks joy or not. 
- The point of a photo is to capture a special moment in time. Most photographs serve their purpose the moment you take them. Discard these ones and keep only those that bring you pleasure every time you look at them. 
- Do not hoard photos from trips. You can capture the essence of an entire day with about 5 good quality photos. 
- Really important things are not that great in number. Keep the photos that capture these moments and part with the ones that are only of monotonous scenes or unremarkable moments.

#### Reduce until you reach the point where something clicks
- Sort by category, in the correct order, and keep only those things that inspire joy. Do this thoroughly and quickly, all in one go. If you follow this advice, you will dramatically reduce the volume of things you own, experience an exhilaration you have never known before, and gain confidence in your life.
- As you reduce your belongings through the process of tidying, you will come to a point where you suddenly know how much is just right for you. It will feel like something has "clicked" inside your head. This is known as the "just-right-click-point." 
- This point differs person to person, but once you pass it you will find that the amount of things you owns never increases past this point. This is why you will never experience rebound.
- As you put your house in order and decrease the amount of possession you have, you'll see what your true values are, what is really important to you in your life. Don't focus on reducing, or on efficient storage methods though. Focus instead on choosing the things that inspire joy and on enjoying life according to your own standards. This is the true pleasure of tidying. 

#### Follow your intuition and all will be well
- It is important to follow your intuition when tidying. Following strict rules set by other people will have no lasting effect on you because you are not them. Only you can know which items you should keep, which ones you should discard, and what kind of environment makes you happy. The act of picking up and choosing which objects to keep is extremely personal. 
- To avoid rebound, you need to create your own tidying method with your own standards. This is precisely why it is so important to identify how you feel about each and every item you own. 
- By paring down to the volume of items that you can properly handle, you revitalize your relationship with your belongings. Through the process of selecting only those things that inspire joy, you can identify precisely what you love and what you need. 
- When we honestly confront the things we own, they evoke many emotions within us. Those feelings are real. It is these emotions that give us the energy for living. 
- Believe what your heart tells you when you ask, "Does this spark joy?" If you act on the intuition, you will be amazed at how things will begin to connect in your life and the dramatic changes that follow. It is as if your life has been touched by magic. 
- Putting your house in order is the magic that creates a vibrant and happy life.

## Storing Your Things To Make Your Life Shine

#### Designate a place for each thing
- Designate a specific place to keep every single thing you own.
- Although it seems like deciding on a place for every item must be complicated, it's far simpler than deciding what to keep and what to discard. 
- Once you have decided on what to keep according to type of item and since all of those items will belong to the same category, all you need to do is store them near each other.
- The reason every item must have a designated place is because the existence of an item without a home multiplies the chances that your space will become cluttered again. 
- You only need to designate a spot for every item once.
- The essence of effective storage is this: designate a spot for every last thing you own. If you ignore this basic principle, you will likely fall back into clutter.
- Once you choose a place for your things, you can keep your house in order. Decide where your things belong and when you finish using them, put them there.

#### Discard first, store later
- Many people claim that they do not have enough storage space in their homes. This is rarely the real issue. The real issue for most people is that they have far more than they need or want.
- Once you learn how to choose your belongings properly, you will be left only with the amount that fits perfectly in the space you currently have. This is why tidying must begin with discarding.
- Once you have finished discarding, it's easy to decide where things should go because your possessions will have been reduced to a fraction of what you started out with. 
- Conversely, no matter how hard you tidy and no matter how elegant the storage method, if you start storing before you have eliminated excess, you will rebound.

#### Storage: pursue ultimate simplicity
- Most people realize that clutter is caused by too much stuff. But why do we have too much stuff? Usually it is because we do not accurately grasp how much we actually own.
- We often fail to grasp how much we own because our storage methods are too complex. 
- The ability to avoid excess depends on the ability to simplify storage.
- The secret to maintaining an uncluttered room is to pursue ultimate simplicity in storage so that you can tell at a glance how much you have.
- Keep storage as simple as possible.

#### Don't scatter storage spaces
- There are only two rules that you need to follow to keep clutter at bay: store all items of the same type in the same place and don't scatter storage spaces.
- If you life with family, first clearly define separate storage spaces for each family member.

#### Forget about "flow planning" and "frequency of use"
- A common mistake many people make is to decide where to store things on the basis of where it's easiest to take them out. This is a terrible mistake.
- Clutter is caused by a failure to return things to where they belong. Therefore, storage should reduce the effort needed to put things away, not the effort needed to get them out. 
- Clutter has only two causes: too much effort is required to put things away (as mentioned above) or it is unclear where things belong.
- There is no need to get complicated here. Just designate where to keep your things in accordance with the design of your home and your storage problems will be solved.
- Store everything similar in the same place or in close proximity. Don't disperse your storage space.
- When you are choosing what to keep, ask your heart; when you are choosing where to store something, ask your house.

#### Never pile things: vertical storage is key
- When it comes to storage, vertical is best.
- If you have storage space that should be sufficient yet falls short, try standing things vertically. This solves most problems.
- There are two reasons to store things vertically and avoid stacking. First, if you stack things, you end up with what seems like inexhaustible storage space. Things can be stacked forever and endlessly on top, which makes it hard to notice the increasing volume. When you store things vertically, any increase takes up space and you will eventually run out of storage area. 
- The second reason to avoid stacking is that stacking is very hard on things at the bottom. Stacking weakens and exhausts the things on the bottom that bear the weight of the pile. Things in the pile also virtually disappear because we forget that they even exist.

#### No need for commercial storage items
- The only storage items you need are plain old drawers and boxes — you don't need anything special or fancy. 
- Round, heart-shaped, and irregularly shaped containers are not ideal for storage because they usually waste space.
- Don't buy any storage containers until after you have discarded and know what items you will need to store.

#### The best way to store bags is in another bag
- The best way to store purses, handbags, and other bags is to make sets according to the material, size, and frequency of use and to store them one inside the other, like nested boxes.
- All straps and handles should be left in plain view. If the handbag used for storage came in a bag, you can store the set in that. 
- Line up these sets in your closet, wardrobe, or on top of a shelf where you can see them. 

#### Empty your bag every day
- Empty your bag every day. This is not as bothersome as it sounds. You just need to make a place for the things inside of it. Find a box and place your ID, wallet, and other important things in it. Keep this box in a drawer, cupboard, or on a shelf.
- If you don't do this every single day, no need to worry. There are times where this makes sense, such as when you get home late and will be leaving early the next morning. The important thing is it create an environment where your bag can have a rest by designating a specific place to store everything you usually carry inside of it.

#### Items that usurp floor space belong in the closet
- To effectively use a closet, follow these guidelines.
- Off-season clothing should be kept on the top shelf of the closet. This is also the best spot for large mementos that will not fit in a bookcase, such as wedding albums or other photo albums. Don't put them in boxes though. Instead, stand them up toward the front of the cupboard as you would books in a bookcase.
- Regular clothes that will not be in dressers should be stored in the closet.
- Bedding is best stored on the upper shelf of the closet where it is less exposed to humidity and dust. The bottom space of the closet can be used to store electrical appliances such as fans and space heaters. 

#### Keep things out of the bath and kitchen sink
- There is no need to keep soaps and shampoos out when we are not using them, and the added exposure to heat and moisture when they aren't in use is bound to affect their quality. For these reasons, you should keep everything out of the bath/shower and only bring them to the bath/shower when in use. After taking a bath/shower, dry them off and store them somewhere else, like under the sink.
- This same principle applies to your kitchen sink. Store your dish soap away from the sink, like underneath it. Wring out and hang your sponge to dry when not in use to prevent it from smelling. 
- Extend this idea to the things you keep around your stove. If you keep bottles of oil, seasonings, etc right next to the stove full time, they will inevitably get coated with a layer of grease and food particles. Store these things in a cupboard or drawer.

#### Don't underestimate the noise of written information
- A deluge of written information makes a room feel "noisy," especially if the words are in your own language. Written words jump into your line of vision and your brain treats them as information to be sorted. This created unneeded commotion in your mind.
- Areas within a home that feel "noisy" even though they look very neat on the surface are usually overflowing with unnecessary information. The neater the house and the more sparse its furnishings, the louder this information feels. 
- By eliminating excess visual information that doesn't inspire joy or have a use, you can make your space much more peaceful and comfortable.

## The Magic of Tidying Dramatically Transforms Your Life

#### Put your house in order and discover what you really want to do
- At their core, the things we really like do not change much over time. Putting your house in order is a great way to discover what they are.
- Although we can get to know ourselves better by sitting down and analyzing our characteristics or by listening to others' perspectives on us, tidying may be the best way. After all, our possessions very accurately relate the history of the decisions we have made in life. Tidying is a way of taking stock that shows us what we really like.

#### The magic effect of tidying
- The lives of those who tidy thoroughly and completely, in a single shot, are dramatically altered.
- One of the magical effects of tidying is confidence in your decision-making capacity. Tidying means taking each item in your hand, asking yourself if it sparks joy, and deciding on this basis whether or not to keep it. By repeating this process hundreds and thousands of times, we naturally hone our decision making skills.

#### An attachment to the past or anxiety about the future
- It is not that difficult to identify something that brings you joy. The moment you touch it, you know the answer. 
- It is much more difficult to decide to discard something. We come up with all kinds of reasons for not doing it.
- When we really delve into the reasons for why we cant let something go, there are only two: an attachment to the past or a fear for the future.
- During the selection process, if you come across something that does not spark joy but that you just can't bring yourself to throw away, stop a moment and ask yourself, "Am I having trouble getting rid of this because of an attachment to the past or because of a fear for the future?" 
- The more you do this with your items, the sooner you will begin to see a pattern in your ownership of things. This pattern will fall into one of three categories: attachment to the past, desire for stability in the future, or a combination of both. 
- It's important to understand your ownership pattern because it is an expression of the values that guide your life. The question of what you want to own is actually the question of how you want to live your life. 
- Attachment to the past and fears concerning the future not only govern the way you select the things you own but also represent the criteria by which you make choices in every aspect of your life, including your relationships with people and your job.
- The best way to find out what we need is to get rid of what we don't.
- The process of facing and selecting our possessions can be quite painful. It forces us to confront our imperfections and inadequacies and the foolish choices we made in the past. 
- The things we own are real. They exist here and now as a result of choices made in the past by no one else but ourselves. It is dangerous to ignore them or to discard them indiscriminately as if denying the choices we made.
- It is only when we face the things we own one by one and experience the emotions they evoke that we can truly appreciate our relationship with them.
- There are three approaches we can take toward our possessions: face them now, face them sometime later, or avoid them until the day we die. The choice is ours. 
- If we face our possessions now and acknowledge our attachment to the past and our fears for the future by honestly looking at our possessions, we will be able to see what is really important to us. This process in turn helps us identify our values and reduces doubt and confusion in making life decisions.
- If we can have confidence in our decisions and launch enthusiastically into action without any doubts holding us back, we will be able to achieve much more. 
- The sooner we confront our possessions, the better. If you are going to put your house in order, do it now.

#### Learning that you can do without
- Discarding the things that don't spark joy has no adverse effects whatsoever.
- Any problem caused by lack of something can be solved through action.
- One of the reasons clutter eats away at us us because we have to search for something just to find out whether it's even there.
- When we have reduced the amount we own and store our items in the same place every time we are done using them, we can tell at a glance whether we have it or not. This is a massive stress reliever.
- Life becomes far easier once you know that things will still work out even if you are lacking something.
